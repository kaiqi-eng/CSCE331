            <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
            <p>I am proficient in several programming languages, including Python, Java, and JavaScript, with intermediate to advanced skills in each. However, C++ is my strongest language, where I can effectively utilize most, if not all, of the language's features and have extensive knowledge of most of its libraries. My specialization lies in developing backend applications, particularly databases and processing algorithms. Additionally, I have extensive experience with cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and most proficiently, Microsoft Azure, which has equipped me with valuable DevOps skills, particularly in deploying cloud solutions. My familiarity extends to a wide range of cloud services, from Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to Software as a Service (SaaS), including staging environments and backup services. I have also worked on optimizing system performance and implementing security best practices to enhance both efficiency and security of cloud infrastructure. Furthermore, I have experience working with Git and other version control systems that enable the implementation of continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Lastly, as a bonus, I am deeply experienced in the Google and Microsoft office suites and can work professionally using them.</p>
            <h3>Areas of interest</h3>
            <p>My passions and interests lie in studying and learning about cutting-edge technology, especially machine learning and new, emerging, programming languages. For machine learning and artificial intelligence, I am interested in optimization, specifically on the side of optimizing the training of both Analytical AI models and Generative AI models, as I am fascinated with how code and simulations of neurons can break down and create new things from just data and linear algebra using principles such as  activation functions, backpropagation, and various network architectures. On the side of emerging programming languages, I’m keeping an eye on Carbon, a successor for C++ designed by Google and set to release an experimental version in 2025. Carbon’s promises of improving C++, a very fast and optimized language developed over decades, while also maintaining backwards compatibility leads me to think it will be the next most widely used programming language. I pride myself on staying proactive in learning about new technologies, especially in this rapidly evolving field of computer science and engineering, and I’m excited about preparing myself for future developments in AI and Machine Learning.
